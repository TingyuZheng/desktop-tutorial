Thank you for your review and comment.
These weeks I have been trying to collect data sources. 

About venues:
1. For Dianping, I have got some overal data about venues from the app. Combining it with data got from Gaode, it could be more complete.
2. TODO:Other sources like Strip website can be put into database for further use. Try to collect more.

About scripts:
1. Have collected several websites for scripts information
2. TODO:Scrap and save scripts information into database.

About activities and communities:
1. Data from Douban Events.
2. TODO:Dianping Tuangou and other activities planification websites to be collected and scrapted.

Segmentation of my website would be 
1. A collection of more complete mystery murder game information of SHANGHAI. 
2. An online friendly and genuine community to be built for communication between playes as well as players and dms from venues.
