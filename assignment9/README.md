The two element I chose were :
1. "立即预约“ on the sidebox. This one is one of the most crucial part of my flow because my propose is to provide users an appoinment system for them to play games with other fans and the company can help them communicate with the venues.
2. ”评论约本“ on the bottom of the page. The aim of the website is to buid an online community for scripts games fans to gather information, exchange information and commmunicate with each other so that they can play games with stranger players. The website provides them with a platform to try out venues and scripts, and get to know other players. Venues can promote their new or popular scripts on the website and call on for game testing.

This page is details of one 约本 activity.
